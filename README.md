# Hospital Management System - Microservices with Spring Cloud

## Overview
This project is a hospital management system developed using Spring Cloud microservices. The goal is to create a modular, scalable system that efficiently manages patients, doctors, and appointments within a hospital.

Each service operates independently, allowing for ease of scaling, flexibility in deployment, and clear separation of concerns.
